# Banking Fraud Detection

## Overview

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that form the basis of a data science project focused on fraud detection. The project is structured into three main components: data analysis, data forecasting, and data modeling.

## Notebooks

### Data Analysis (`data_analysis.ipynb`)

This notebook is dedicated to the initial exploration and analysis of the dataset. It includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Initial insights and observations

### Data Modeling (`data_modeling.ipynb`)

The final notebook is dedicated to building and evaluating machine learning models for predicting bank reserve levels. It includes:

- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Model selection and training (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and comparison

### Data Forecasting (`data_forecasting.ipynb`)

In this notebook, we focus on make predictions on new transactional data. It covers:
- Forecasting and evaluation

## Installation

To run these notebooks, you will need to install the required Python packages. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use these notebooks, simply clone this repository and open the notebooks in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maikpaixao/banking_fraud_analysis.git
cd banking_fraud_analysis
```
